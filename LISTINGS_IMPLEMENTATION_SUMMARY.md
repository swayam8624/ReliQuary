# Listings Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of "listings" functionality for the ReliQuary platform, which includes making the SDKs available through various package repositories.

## Overview

The "listings" functionality enables distribution of ReliQuary SDKs through major package repositories:

- PyPI for Python packages
- npm for JavaScript/TypeScript packages
- Maven Central for Java packages
- GitHub Releases for Go modules

## Implemented Components

### 1. Python SDK (reliquary-sdk)

**Files Created:**

- `sdk/python/setup.py` - Traditional setup configuration
- `sdk/python/pyproject.toml` - Modern packaging configuration
- `sdk/python/README.md` - Documentation
- `sdk/python/LICENSE` - License file

**Features:**

- Asynchronous client implementation
- Multi-agent consensus operations
- Zero-knowledge proof generation
- AI/ML enhanced decisions
- Cross-chain interactions
- Observability and monitoring

### 2. JavaScript SDK (@reliquary/sdk)

**Files Enhanced:**

- `sdk/javascript/package.json` - Already existed with proper configuration
- `sdk/javascript/README.md` - Documentation
- `sdk/javascript/LICENSE` - License file

**Features:**

- TypeScript support
- Promise-based asynchronous operations
- Comprehensive API coverage
- Browser and Node.js compatibility

### 3. Java SDK (io.reliquary:reliquary-sdk)

**Files Created:**

- `sdk/java/pom.xml` - Maven configuration
- `sdk/java/README.md` - Documentation
- `sdk/java/LICENSE` - License file

**Features:**

- Synchronous and asynchronous APIs
- Comprehensive data models
- Exception handling
- Builder pattern for requests

### 4. Go SDK (github.com/reliquary/go-sdk)

**Files Created:**

- `sdk/go/go.mod` - Go module configuration
- `sdk/go/README.md` - Documentation
- `sdk/go/LICENSE` - License file

**Features:**

- Context-aware operations
- Configurable client options
- Comprehensive API coverage
- Built-in performance tracking

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Python SDK Publishing

- File: `.github/workflows/publish-python-sdk.yml`
- Triggers on release publication
- Builds and publishes to PyPI

### 2. JavaScript SDK Publishing

- File: `.github/workflows/publish-js-sdk.yml`
- Triggers on release publication
- Builds and publishes to npm

### 3. Java SDK Publishing

- File: `.github/workflows/publish-java-sdk.yml`
- Triggers on release publication
- Builds and publishes to Maven Central

### 4. Go SDK Publishing

- File: `.github/workflows/publish-go-sdk.yml`
- Triggers on release publication
- Tags and pushes to GitHub

### 5. Unified SDK Publishing

- File: `.github/workflows/publish-all-sdks.yml`
- Orchestrates publishing of all SDKs in sequence

## Configuration Requirements

### Repository Accounts Needed:

1. **PyPI** - For Python package distribution
2. **npm** - For JavaScript package distribution
3. **Sonatype OSSRH** - For Maven Central publishing
4. **GitHub** - For Go module versioning

### GitHub Secrets Required:

- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - PyPI authentication
- `NPM_TOKEN` - npm authentication
- `OSSRH_USERNAME` - Maven Central username
- `OSSRH_TOKEN` - Maven Central password
- `MAVEN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` - Artifact signing key
- `MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE` - Signing key passphrase

## Publishing Process

### Automated Publishing:

1. Create GitHub Release with semantic version tag
2. Workflows automatically trigger and publish to all repositories

### Manual Publishing:

1. Update version numbers in configuration files
2. Run workflows manually from GitHub Actions interface

## Verification

After publishing, packages are available at:

- **PyPI**: https://pypi.org/project/reliquary-sdk/
- **npm**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reliquary/sdk
- **Maven Central**: https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.reliquary/reliquary-sdk
- **Go**: `go get github.com/reliquary/go-sdk@latest`

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

- `SDK_PUBLISHING_GUIDE.md` - Complete publishing instructions
- Individual README.md files for each SDK with usage examples
- Inline code documentation in all SDK implementations

## Next Steps

1. Set up repository accounts and obtain API tokens
2. Configure GitHub secrets with authentication credentials
3. Test publishing workflows with a pre-release version
4. Monitor package downloads and user feedback
5. Implement automated testing for all SDKs

This implementation provides a complete foundation for distributing ReliQuary SDKs through major package repositories, enabling developers to easily integrate with the platform in their preferred programming language.
