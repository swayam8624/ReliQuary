## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- `conda` (Anaconda or Miniconda)
- `Rust` (with `cargo`)
- `Node.js` (for SnarkJS, required for ZK proof generation/verification)
- `Docker` and `Docker Compose`

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SwayamSingal/ReliQuary.git
   cd ReliQuary
   ```

2. **Conda Environment Setup:**

   ```bash
   conda create -n reliquary-env python=3.11 -y
   conda activate reliquary-env
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies (using Poetry):**

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Install Rust Toolchain (if not already installed):**

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   ```

5. **Build Rust Modules:**

   ```bash
   # From the root of the project
   cd rust_modules/encryptor
   cargo build --release
   cd ../merkle
   cargo build --release
   cd ../.. # Back to project root
   ```

6. **Install Node.js Dependencies for ZK (SnarkJS):**

   ```bash
   # Assuming Node.js is installed
   npm install -g snarkjs
   ```

7. **Run the API (Development Mode):**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

ReliQuary provides official Docker images for easy deployment across multiple environments. Our images are built for multiple architectures (AMD64, ARM64, ARMv7) and are available on Docker Hub.

### Official Docker Images

| Image | Tag | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| [swayamsingal/reliquary-platform](https://hub.docker.com/r/swayamsingal/reliquary-platform) | v5.0.0 | Main ReliQuary platform |
| [swayamsingal/reliquary-agent-orchestrator](https://hub.docker.com/r/swayamsingal/reliquary-agent-orchestrator) | v5.0.0 | Agent orchestrator service |
| [swayamsingal/reliquary-website](https://hub.docker.com/r/swayamsingal/reliquary-website) | v1.0.0 | Marketing website |

### Pull and Run Docker Images

```bash
# Pull the platform image
docker pull swayamsingal/reliquary-platform:v5.0.0

# Run the platform container
docker run -d \
  --name reliquary-platform \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e RELIQUARY_ENV=production \
  swayamsingal/reliquary-platform:v5.0.0

# Pull the website image
docker pull swayamsingal/reliquary-website:v1.0.0

# Run the website container
docker run -d \
  --name reliquary-website \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  swayamsingal/reliquary-website:v1.0.0
```

### Docker Compose Setup

For a complete development environment, use our Docker Compose configuration:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SwayamSingal/ReliQuary.git
cd ReliQuary

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d
```

### Building from Source

To build Docker images from source:

```bash
# Build platform image
docker build -t reliquary/platform:v5.0.0 -f Dockerfile.platform --target production .

# Build orchestrator image
docker build -t reliquary/agent-orchestrator:v5.0.0 -f Dockerfile.agent-orchestrator .

# Build website image
docker build -t reliquary/website:v1.0.0 -f website/Dockerfile .
```

### Multi-Architecture Support

Our Docker images support multiple architectures:
- AMD64 (x86_64)
- ARM64 (aarch64)
- ARMv7 (armhf)

To build for specific architectures:
```bash
# Build for ARM64
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t reliquary/platform:v5.0.0 .

# Build for multiple architectures
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 -t reliquary/platform:v5.0.0 .
```
