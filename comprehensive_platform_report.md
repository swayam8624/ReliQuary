## Security Analysis

The ReliQuary platform implements multiple layers of security:

1. **Authentication Layer**: OAuth 2.0 and WebAuthn biometric authentication
2. **Authorization Layer**: Enhanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
3. **Privacy Layer**: Zero-knowledge verification and privacy-preserving access control
4. **Audit Layer**: Merkle tree-based audit logging for data integrity
5. **Trust Layer**: Dynamic trust scoring for adaptive security

## Performance Characteristics

Based on previous benchmarking:

- Sub-15ms response times for core health checks
- 100% reliability under test conditions
- Support for concurrent user access

## Research Impact

This platform demonstrates several important research contributions:

1. **Privacy-Preserving Verification**: Implementation of zero-knowledge proofs that enable verification without exposing sensitive data
2. **Decentralized Identity Management**: Integration of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for user-controlled identity
3. **Adaptive Trust Models**: Dynamic trust scoring system that evolves from static permissions to context-aware security
4. **Auditability**: Merkle tree-based logging for immutable audit trails
5. **Scalability**: Architecture designed for high-concurrency environments
