- Decentralized Identifiers (DID) registration and resolution
- WebAuthn integration for biometric and hardware key authentication

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Context Verification

- Implementation of ZK proof system with Circom and SnarkJS
- Context verification circuits for device, location, timestamp, and pattern matching
- Trust scoring engine with dynamic evaluation
- Integration with authentication system for enhanced security

### 4. Multi-Agent Consensus System

- Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus algorithms for distributed decision making
- Specialized agent nodes: Neutral, Permissive, Strict, and Watchdog
- Encrypted memory system with database manager for persistent agent memory
- Threshold cryptography for secret sharing and multi-party computation

### 5. Cross-Chain and AI/ML Integration

- Cross-chain integration protocols for blockchain interoperability
- Advanced AI/ML algorithms for intelligent decision-making and behavioral pattern analysis
- Scalability optimizations for large-scale networks (100+ agents)
- Comprehensive observability system with real-time monitoring and alerting

## SaaS Platform Implementation

### API Key Management System

The API key management system is a comprehensive solution for controlling access to the ReliQuary platform. It includes:

#### Key Features

1. **Multi-environment Support**: Keys can be created for development, staging, and production environments
2. **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits per key (requests per hour)
3. **Permission-based Access**: Fine-grained permissions system with predefined permission sets
4. **Quota Management**: Tenant-based quota enforcement with configurable limits
5. **Key Rotation**: Secure key rotation without changing metadata
6. **IP Address Restrictions**: Optional IP whitelisting for enhanced security
7. **Expiration Dates**: Time-based key expiration for temporary access
8. **Usage Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of API requests and quota consumption

#### Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js component with Framer Motion animations
- **Backend**: TypeScript service layer with comprehensive type definitions
- **State Management**: React hooks for API key management, rate limiting, and tenant quotas
- **UI Components**:
  - Key visibility toggle (show/hide)
  - Copy to clipboard functionality
  - Modal dialogs for creation and deletion
  - Visual indicators for key status and environment
  - Permission management interface
  - Rate limit presets

#### Data Model

```typescript
interface ApiKey {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  key: string;
  createdAt: string;
  lastUsed: string;
  expiresAt?: string;
  status: "active" | "inactive" | "expired";
  permissions: string[];
  rateLimit: number; // requests per hour
  environment: "development" | "staging" | "production";
  allowedIps?: string[];
  tenantId: string;
}
```

### Dashboard Implementation

The customer dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for managing API keys and monitoring usage:

#### Features

1. **Tab-based Navigation**: Overview, API Keys, Usage & Analytics, Billing, and Settings
2. **Usage Statistics**: Real-time display of API requests, response times, and error rates
3. **Visual Progress Indicators**: Monthly usage tracking with progress bars
4. **Recent Activity Feed**: Timeline of API key usage
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with smooth animations

#### Technical Components

- **Framer Motion**: For smooth page transitions and animations
- **Heroicons**: Consistent iconography throughout the interface
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for rapid UI development
- **React Hooks**: State management for UI components

## Enterprise Features

### SDK Development

- Enterprise-grade SDKs for Python, JavaScript, Java, and Go
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI

### Deployment and Infrastructure

- Production deployment with Kubernetes
- CI/CD pipelines with infrastructure as code
- Multi-architecture Docker builds
- Container security scanning and vulnerability management

### Security and Compliance

- Comprehensive security audit and penetration testing
- GDPR compliance framework
- Data processing agreements
- Terms of service and privacy policy templates
